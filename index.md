The Gambit system is an easy to understand, easy to implement, hard to execute training framework.

If you want to dive right in, here are the simple rules

- Use the three basic exercises:

  - pushups, squats, jumping jacks

- Grab and shuffle a deck of cards
- Flip a card perform as many repetitions as the card's value of pushups
- Flip another card perform as many repetitions as the card's value of squats
- Flip another card perform as many repetitions as the card's value of jumping jacks
- Repeat till the deck is over
